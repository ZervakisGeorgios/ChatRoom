# ChatRoom

In this repository, you will find a basic TCP chat room.

The server.py file runs on the server. This can just run locally on your machine. This script should be the first one to start. That is to start up the listener, waiting for the clients to join

The file client.py runs from the client machines. As soon as a client runs the script, they are asked to provide a nickname. After having entered a nickname, the client joins the chat room. At this point, the client can type messages that will be visible to all other clients that have joined the chat room.

TESTING
1. Download the files
2. Run the server.py
3. Run the client.py twice to simulate two clients
4. send messages from the clients

You can run the scripts simply from windows cmd (python server.py)
